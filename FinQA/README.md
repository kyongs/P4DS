## Requirements

```
uv >= 0.6.14, python >= 3.13
```

## Installation

```
$ uv venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set Environment

You should create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will contain your OpenAI API key.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="[your_openai_api_key]"
```

## Project Structure

The code has been organized to separate the MCP server logic from the Streamlit UI:

- `mcp_handler.py`: Contains the core logic for MCP client initialization and query processing
- `streamlit_app.py`: Contains the Streamlit UI code that utilizes the MCP handler

This separation allows for easier maintenance and future enhancements.

## Running the Streamlit App

To run the Streamlit web interface:

```
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This will launch a web server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the interface.

## Run MCP Client and Get Accuracy

To run the batch processing and accuracy evaluation:

```
$ python mcp_client.py
$ python score.py
```
